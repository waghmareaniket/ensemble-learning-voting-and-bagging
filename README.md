# ensemble-learning-voting-and-bagging
I implemented ensemble learning techniques Bagging and Voting both classification and regression using Scikit-learn. The model Decision Trees, (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to enhance accuracy and reduce overfitting. ensemble methods improve model robustness , with performance evaluated using metrics like accuracy
